# Introduction {.unnumbered}

This website contains an evolving thematic catalogue of František Ignác Antonín Tůma's works.

::: {.callout-important}
## Caution

This catalogue is **work-in-progress** and likely contains errors or duplicate entries. Its contents are subject to change as we screen more and more manuscripts.

For general and biographical information on Werner, see @Postolka2001 and @Slavicky2006.


## Overview

We classify Tůma's works as *Vocal music* (groups A to I) and *instrumental music* (groups J to M); moreover, an appendix contains spurious and uncertain attributions (group Z). Groups A, C, D, and F are further divided into subgroups to provide a more fine-grained classification and to preserve work numbering if further works are discovered. The catalogue also cites lost works whose existence has been sufficiently proven.

**Vocal music** comprises

- *A. Masses*<br/>
  (1) pure a capella style<br/>
  (2) free a capella style<br/>
  (3) modern style<br/>
  (4) lost works<br/>
  (5) spurious works
- *B. Requiems*
- *C. Short liturgical works*<br/>
  (1) Graduals<br/>
  (2) Hymns<br/>
  (3) Motets<br/>
  (4) Offertories
- *D. Vespers*<br/>
  (1) Complete vespers<br/>
  (2) Psalms<br/>
  (3) Magnificats
- *E. Responsories*
- *F. Marian antiphons*<br/>
  (1) Alma redemptoris mater<br/>
  (2) Ave regina coelorum<br/>
  (3) Salve regina
- *G. Sequences*
- *H. Litanies*
- *I. Varia*

**Instrumental music** comprises

- *J. Sonatas*
- *K. Sinfonias*
- *L. Partitas*
- *M. Varia*

Currently, the catalogue contains the following information for each work:

- title
- sources (linked to the respective RISM entry), and
- one preliminary incipit (i.e., the first incipit of the first source with RISM entry).

For an increasing number of works, detailed metadata in MEI format [@MEI2023] is available.

Works in the catalogue should be cited by the abbreviation “Fiat”, followed by the group, subgroup (if applicable), and work number; the latter three components should be separated by a period.


## Methods

We consulted the following sources, of which some contain partial catalogues of Werner's works:

- @Vogg1951 – catalogue of known works known around 1950
- @Peschek1956 – masses
- @Klinka1975 – vocal works, including practical editions of several motets
- @Eitner1903 – sources known around 1900
- @Riedel1979 – works in the Göttweig Abbey archive

The work list assembled from these sources (`data/catalogue_works.csv`) was checked against and supplemented by RISM entries. To this end, entries were downloaded via [*sru-downloader*](https://github.com/rism-international/sru-downloader) on 2023-01-27, yielding 305 entries:

```bash
java -jar SRUDownloader.jar "https://muscat.rism.info/sru/sources?operation=searchRetrieve&version=1.1&query=creator=%22T%C5%AFma,%20Franti%C5%A1ek%20Ign%C3%A1c%20Anton%C3%ADn%22&maximumRecords=100"
grep -v "<zs:" output.xml | \
  grep -v "</zs:" | \
  grep -v "<marc:collection" | \
  grep -v "</marc:collection" | \
  sed '1 a\<marc:collection xmlns:marc="http://www.loc.gov/MARC21/slim">' | \
  sed '$ a\</marc:collection>' \
  > rism_entries.xml
rm output.xml
```
In the resulting XML file, all tags in the `zs` namespace were removed, yielding the XML file `data/rism_entries.xml`, which only contains [MarcXML](https://www.loc.gov/standards/marcxml/) tags. From this file, searchable HTML tables were created via `script/parse_rism_search_results.py` and `make_rism_tables.R` and stored in `data_generated/rism_tables/`.

Pages for each group of works were generated automatically from `catalogue_works.csv` (via `script/prepare_works.R` and `utils.R`). For each work, one incipit was generated from the Plaine & Easie Code of the first source with a RISM entry. Data from the [RISM Catalogue](https://opac.rism.info) by the *Répertoire International des Sources Musicales* is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution CC-BY 3.0 Unported License.

Detailed work metadata was edited with [MerMEId v2.0](https://mermeid.edirom.de/). Incipits were prepared with [MuseScore](https://musescore.org) and polished with [mei-friend](https://mei-friend.mdw.ac.at). HTML pages were exported from MerMEId and post-processed (`sed -i 's/.png/.svg/g' work.html`). These pages are rendered using the [BravuraText](https://github.com/steinbergmedia/bravura) font v1.392 and [Verovio](https://www.verovio.org).
